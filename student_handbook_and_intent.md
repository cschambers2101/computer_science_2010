# Student Handbook – Computer Science

# BTEC Level 3 Subsidiary Diploma in IT

# Course intent

This course has been designed to move people on their journey to working in the software industry. The course is taught through a project based
methodology with teams working to design, build and test open ended tasks. The curriculum has been designed to allow students to grow into independent learners with the resilience required to work in the fast paced technology industry.

The course is taught through six units selected to support software development. Two are mandatory units for the course and the remaining four units selected to support the core aim. In year one we complete the two mandatory units in terms one and two respectively, with the third unit taught throughout the year. This allows you the most time to learn the concepts required to take you onto the large work based assignments in year two based around designing, building and testing an application. The final two units of the course are taught and assessed together, meaning you must create a more complex application than you would if we taught them individually. This will mirror a real world work environment.

## Year one

- Unit 1 Communication and Employability Skills in IT Term 1

- Unit 2 Computer Systems Term 2

- Unit 20 Client Side Customisation of Web Pages All Year

## Year two

- Unit 6 Software Design and Development Term 1

- Unit 14 Event Driven Programming Term 2 and 3

- Unit 15 Object Oriented Programming Term 2 and 3

# Assignments

You can expect two to three assignments for each unit on the course. These will be labeled assignment_unit number.assignment_number. E.g. Assignment 2.1. This indicates that the assignment is from unit 2 and is the second assignment for that unit. In year two where the units are joined assignments will be labelled programming-assignment.assignment number.

# Technical Education Student Handbook

This course handbook, must be read in conjunction with the Technical Education Handbook, as this outlines what you can and can’t do when it comes to assessment on the course. It includes important sections on plagiarism and the impact this can have on your learning, plus sections on how assignments work.
